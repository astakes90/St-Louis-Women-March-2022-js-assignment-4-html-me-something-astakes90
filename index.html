      <img src="images/IMG_5986.jpeg" alt="Ginger and white colored dog sitting" width="375" height="500">
      <p>Ralphie is a Beagle/Corgi mix. Most folks think that he is named after the kid from A Christmas Story, but he's actually named after Jean-Ralphio Saperstein from the show Parks & Recreation. He was born on May 8, 2014 and we brought him home in July of that same year. He is a Taurus, and much like a Taurus he isn't fond of change. He is a friendly pup and loves his lazy life.</p>

      <h2 id = "headers">My Cat Donut</h2>
      <img src="images/IMG_6649.jpeg" alt="Tri-colored cat sitting" width="375" height="500">
      <p>Donut is a Calico cat. We brought her home from the shelter in January 2020 and she immediately crowned herself queen of our household. She is the most snuggly, talkative kitty that I have ever encountered. She also loves to twist and squiggle around on the ground while she receives belly and cheek scratches. She was born September 25, 2019 and is as loyal as Libras come.</p>

      <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">Ralphie and Donut get along swimmingly. They regularly play together and know exactly when to stop before it gets out of hand. Donut loves to rub up against Ralphie and claim him. They are a perfect pairing because Donut is a lot like a dog and Ralphie is a lot like a cat. As mentioned previously, Donut loves a good belly scratch. Ralphie loves to perch on the back of the couch. And they both like to sleep, sleep, sleep!</p>
